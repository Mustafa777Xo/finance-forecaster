# Project Success Metrics

## Overview

This document defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and success criteria for the finance forecasting system. These metrics ensure the model delivers reliable, actionable predictions while maintaining high accuracy and appropriate uncertainty quantification.

## Primary Success Metrics

### 1. Forecast Accuracy
**Metric**: 30-day balance forecast Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ≤ 5% of user's average monthly income

**Definition**: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual account balances over a 30-day horizon should not exceed 5% of the user's typical monthly income.

**Rationale**:
- Provides actionable accuracy for financial planning decisions
- Scales appropriately with user's income level
- Accounts for natural variance in spending patterns

**Measurement**:
```
MAE = (1/n) * Σ|predicted_balance - actual_balance|
Success: MAE ≤ 0.05 * avg_monthly_income
```

## Secondary Success Metrics

### 2. Prediction Interval Coverage
**Metric**: Prediction interval coverage ≥ 90% on 30-day horizon

**Definition**: The actual balance values should fall within the predicted confidence intervals at least 90% of the time.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures robust uncertainty quantification
- Provides reliable confidence bounds for risk assessment
- Enables better decision-making under uncertainty

**Measurement**:
```
Coverage = (predictions_within_interval / total_predictions) * 100%
Success: Coverage ≥ 90%
```

## Model Monitoring & Maintenance

### 3. Retrain Trigger
**Metric**: Rolling MAE > 7% of average monthly income triggers model retraining

**Definition**: When the 7-day rolling average of forecast errors exceeds 7% of the user's average monthly income, an automated retraining process is initiated.

**Actions Triggered**:
- Automatic model retraining with recent data
- Alert notification to system administrators
- Performance degradation analysis
- Model version rollback if retraining fails

**Rationale**:
- Proactive model maintenance before significant degradation
- Maintains system reliability and user trust
- Balances retraining frequency with computational resources

## Additional Monitoring Metrics

### 4. Operational Metrics
- **Prediction Latency**: < 2 seconds for real-time forecasts
- **Data Freshness**: Training data updated within 24 hours
- **System Uptime**: ≥ 99.5% availability
- **Alert Response Time**: < 15 minutes for critical issues

### 5. Business Impact Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Active forecast usage by ≥ 80% of users monthly
- **Decision Accuracy**: User financial goals met within forecast bounds
- **Cost Savings**: Reduction in overdraft fees or missed payments

## Measurement Framework

### Data Collection
- Continuous logging of predictions vs. actuals
- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- Weekly automated metric reporting
- Monthly model performance reviews

### Reporting Schedule
- **Daily**: System health and basic accuracy metrics
- **Weekly**: Detailed performance analysis and trend identification
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive model evaluation and business impact assessment
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review and metric threshold optimization

## Threshold Justification

| Metric | Threshold | Justification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Primary MAE | ≤ 5% | Provides practical accuracy for budgeting decisions |
| Coverage | ≥ 90% | Industry standard for prediction intervals |
| Retrain Trigger | > 7% | Early warning before significant degradation |

## Success Criteria Validation

The model is considered successful when:
1. ✅ Primary MAE consistently below 5% threshold
2. ✅ Prediction interval coverage maintains ≥ 90%
3. ✅ No retrain triggers for 30+ consecutive days
4. ✅ User satisfaction scores ≥ 4.0/5.0
5. ✅ System uptime within operational targets

## Review and Updates

This metrics framework will be reviewed quarterly to ensure alignment with:
- User needs and feedback
- Business objectives
- Industry best practices
- Regulatory requirements
